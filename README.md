# Terraform AWS Network Example

This folder contains a Terraform module that deploys a simple network setup to demonstrate how you can use Terratest to write automated tests for your AWS Terraform code. This module deploys two subnets within one availability zone. One subnet is public - it has a route to an internet gateway. The other subnet is private. There is a NAT gateway deployed and configured for it. 


## Running this module manually

1. Sign up for [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).
